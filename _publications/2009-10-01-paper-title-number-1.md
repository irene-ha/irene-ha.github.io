excerpt: 'Various ocular diseases such as cataracts, glaucoma, and diabetic retinopathy have become several major factors causing non-congenital visual impairment, which seriously threatens vision health. The shortage of ophthalmic medical resources has brought huge obstacles to large-scale ocular disease screening. Therefore, it is necessary to use computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) technology to achieve large-scale screening and diagnosis of ocular diseases. In this work, inspired by the human visual cognition mechanism, we propose a parallel multi-path network for multiple ocular diseases detection, called PMP-OD, which integrates the detection of multiple common ocular diseases, including cataracts, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and pathological myopia. The bottom-up features of the fundus image are extracted by a common convolutional module, the Low-level Feature Extraction module, which simulates the non-selective pathway. Simultaneously, the top-down vessel and other lesion features are extracted by the High-level Feature Extraction module that simulates the selective pathway. The retinal vessel and lesion features can be regarded as task-driven high-level semantic information in the physician disease diagnosis process. Then, the features are fused by a feature fusion module based on the attention mechanism. Finally, the disease classifier gives prediction results according to the integrated multi-features. The experimental results indicate that our PMP-OD model outperforms other state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on an ocular disease dataset reconstructed from ODIR-5K, APTOS-2019, ORIGA-light, and Kaggle.'
